# RDC-SLAM
This repository contains code for a real-time distributed cooperative slam(RDC-SLAM) system for ROS compatible platforms. The system takes in point cloud from 3d Lidar as inputs. A demonstration of the system can be found here -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvHQ3VcNWTI

## The system
RDC-SLAM is an online cooperative SLAM system, which consists of three steps to establish a global map by distributively leveraging existing SLAM techniques. First, similar places are recognized as bridges between each robot. Next, the relative pose estimation is computed through the recognized relative places. Finally, a distributed graph optimization approach is used to merge the local maps generated by all robots.

## Dependency
- ROS(tested with kinetic and melodic)
- gtsam(Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping library, 4.0.0-alpha2)
```
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/gtborg/gtsam
$ git checkout b7c695fa71efd43b40972eec154df265617fc07d -b dist-mapper
$ mkdir build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j8
$ sudo make install
```
- libnabo
```
$ git clone git://github.com/ethz-asl/libnabo.git
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ sudo make install
```
- distributed_mapper
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sysuxyt/distributed-mapper.git
$ git checkout -b rdc_slam
$ cd distributed_mapper_core/cpp && mkdir build && cd build 
$ cmake ..
$ make -j8
$ sudo make install
```
## Install
```
mkdir -p rdc_ws && cd rdc_ws
git clone https://github.com/sysuxyt/RDC_SLAM.git
catkin_make -j8
```
## Run the package
- setup the local network and fill in ip address in launch file (base_addr + idRobot)  
  
- run the launch file on each device

- For offline replay, ping message should be record when data collecting or the groundtruth of robots are used to simulate the network environment of limited communication range.
